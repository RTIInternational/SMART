Part 1: Installation
====================

.. note::
	Additional installation instructions and developer notes are available at the `SMART Github code repository <https://github.com/RTIInternational/SMART>`_.

To begin installing SMART, first clone the code repository to the local directory of your choice:

::

	$ git clone https://github.com/RTIInternational/SMART.git

SMART uses Docker in development to aid in dependency management. First, install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_. Then navigate to ``envs/dev`` and run ``docker-compose build`` to build all the images:

::

	$ cd smart/envs/dev
	$ docker-compose build

Next, create the docker volumes where persistent data will be stored: ``docker volume create --name=vol_smart_pgdata`` and ``docker volume create --name=vol_smart_data``.

::

	$ docker volume create --name=vol_smart_pgdata
	$ docker volume create --name=vol_smart_data

Then, migrate the database to ensure the schema is prepared for the application.

::

  $ docker-compose run --rm backend ./migrate.sh

Lastly, run ``docker-compose up`` to start all docker containers.  This will start up the containers in the foreground so you can see the logs.  If you prefer to run the containers in the background use ``docker-compose up -d``. When switching between branches there is no need to run any additional commands (except build if there is dependency change).

::

	$ docker compose up -d

To see SMART in action, navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser of choice.  You should be welcomed by the SMART login screen:

|login-screen|

.. note::

	By default, SMART will use port 8000 for the front-end and port 5432 for the back-end processes. See the SMART code repository README for instructions on how to change the default ports.

Finally, create a profile to start your own new labelling projects or to be added to an existing one:

|sign-up|

.. |login-screen| image:: ./nstatic/img/smart-login-screen.png
.. |sign-up| image:: ./nstatic/img/smart-sign-up.png

**Production Installation**

SMART provides both development and production docker builds depening on user need. The production setup [EMILY differences?]. 
See `envs/prod/README.md` for more information, including instructions on setting up regular backups of the production database.

.. warning::
	Please note that while we do plan to keep SMART up to date as exploits are found in packages, in cases where your project includes sensitive data, we reccomend running SMART inside a closed network.
